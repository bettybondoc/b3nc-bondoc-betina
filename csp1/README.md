**Description**
Being the resident pseudo-wedding planner of family and friends, I personally witnessed how the most gentle brides (and sometimes, grooms) turn into <s>monsters</s> bridezillas. Who can blame them though? The pressure to plan your perfect day can get a little overwhelming especially when you don't know where to start. Soon, you'll find yourself just a couple of months away from your big day with no supplier booked, guestlist doubled and budget out of control. I've created this website in the hope of bringing back the fun in wedding planning. From the most basic requirements to the little details that will make your big day truly special, here's everything you need to achieve your dream wedding.
